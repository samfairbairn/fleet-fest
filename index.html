  <div class="about">
    Kentish Town was originally a settlement along the River Fleet which flowed through the area, and today runs underground. The Kentish Fleet Festival is about celebrating the amazing creativity that runs quietly and unassumingly through Kentish Town- much like the River Fleet itself!
    <br><br>
    Kentish Fleet Festival is brought to you by four local churches in Camden who have joined together to run the festival since 2013. Please do join us for our fun day and BBQ on the Sunday.
